a self-hosted version of [postbaby.org](https://www.postbaby.org)

This was created out of necessity for a sticky-note solution which would facilitate rapid arrangement, editing, and color-coding - with low workflow friction, thanks to its intuitive key-bindings.

🖼️ Works equally well on both, landscape, portrait-oriented monitors, and mobile devices.
